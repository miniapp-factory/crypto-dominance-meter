The files that will need to be edited to satisfy the request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the image‑generation instructions for the new app logo.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a digital coin symbol with a stylized “C” and “D” intertwined, set against a gradient background of deep blue and teal. Subtle glowing effects emanate from the center to convey technology, market dominance, and real‑time data tracking. The design is clean, modern, and conveys the idea of a dashboard or chart overlaying the coin symbol.
